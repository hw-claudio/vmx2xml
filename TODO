*) show at SUSECon


=== UNSOLVED QUESTIONS ===

*) How to deal with multiple OS disks in the same VM?

*) adjust_guestfs.py: installation of virtio drivers in Windows. Windows is low prio, but would be nice to have
   something without relying on v2v-in-place for that.

*) adjust_guestfs.py: how to adjust networking so that the first boot on KVM is reliably successful?

   Major problems are the unpredictable "predictable device names", and the different networking configuration
   tools in different Linux OS.

   Old OSes like centos7 are mostly fine since virtio appears as eth0, and sles with wicked is also ok,
   but we need to deal with netplan, network-manager, systemd-networkd...


=== OTHER DETAILS ===


*) vsock -> useful for anything?
*) --pm suspend_to_mem.enabled=on,suspend_to_disk.enabled=off ?
*) --boot cdrom,fd,hd,network translated from VMX bios.bootOrder ?
*) add bios menuitems? --boot bootmenu.enable=on,bios.useserial=on ?
*) --network add virtualport.* options?

   there are VMX vswitch fields to convert from.
*) investigate vdagent for copy/paste with vnc (no spice). Currently it seems host2guest works but not g2h.
*) install qemu-guest-agent? install spice-vdagent for VNC clipboard?
